**Expert Action Guide**

- **Oil Cooler Plugging**: Immediate steps
  - **Symptom**: Gradual rise in oil outlet temperature, paired with rising delta-T across cooler and increasing pump head.
  - **Immediate Action**: Reduce turbine load to <60% and increase monitoring cadence to 5-min.
  - **Inspect**: Check strainer differential pressure, remove/clean strainers, verify bypass valves.
  - **Mitigation**: Trigger controlled backwash if equipped; if not, schedule manual cleaning and consider temporary bypass with increased monitoring.
  - **Follow-up**: Resample oil temps and viscosity after cleaning; verify bearing vibration returns to baseline.

- **Transformer Gas Alarms (Acetylene / C2H2)**
  - **Symptom**: Rising C2H2 ppm or a positive upward trend in acetylene over consecutive DGA samples.
  - **Immediate Action**: Raise alarm severity to CRITICAL and notify operations and protection engineers.
  - **Isolate**: Consider partial de-energization of transformer if C2H2 is >10 ppm or trending rapidly.
  - **Diagnostics**: Perform immediate full DGA, dissolved gas chromatography, and visual insulation inspection if safe.
  - **Mitigation**: If arcing is confirmed, implement protective relaying, de-energize, and quarantine the transformer for repair.
  - **Reporting**: Create an incident audit record and attach DGA series, timestamps, and recommended outage window.

These protocols are designed to be followed by senior operations staff and protection engineers. They assume safe access and relevant SOPs already exist for lockout/tagout and electrical work.

- **Bucket Erosion Inspection**:
  - **Symptom**: Increased shell vibration, reduced efficiency, or observed pitting on buckets.
  - **Immediate Action**: Reduce load by 20% and increase vibration sampling to 1-minute intervals.
  - **Inspect**: Visually inspect buckets for pitting, measure runner balance, and take runner out-of-service if >> acceptable tolerances.
  - **Mitigation**: Schedule precision machining or shot-peening; replace buckets when wear exceeds design tolerance or when hydrodynamic profile is altered.

- **Nozzle Realignment**:
  - **Symptom**: Uneven bucket wear, asymmetric vibration, or jet misalignment > 1mm.
  - **Immediate Action**: Park nozzle actuation and place jet in standby; use alignment targets and laser guides to re-zero needle position.
  - **Mitigation**: If mechanical realignment cannot be completed online, schedule short outage to perform nozzle rebuild and replace needles if erosion detected.
  - **Follow-up**: Run nozzle sequencing tests (single-jet then multi-jet) and validate efficiency improvement with post-maintenance acceptance test.
