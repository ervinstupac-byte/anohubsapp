# AnoHUB Application - Live Demonstration Script
**Theme:** The Honest Engineering Tool
**Presenter:** Product Architect
**Duration:** ~5 Minutes

---

## **Introduction: The Pivot to Authenticity**
*(Start on the **Toolbox Launchpad** - effectively the Home/Dashboard)*

**Narrative:**
"Good morning. Today, I am not going to show you a simulation. I am not going to show you what AnoHUB *could* be. I am going to show you what it **is**."

"We have removed the 'magic'. We have removed the AI predictions that guess. We have pivoted entirely to a **Digital Utility** model. This is an offline-first, professional engineering toolbox."

---

## **Scene 1: The Clean Slate**
**Action:**
1.  Navigate to the **Dashboard** (`/`).
2.  *(If existing data exists, clear it beforehand or point out the 'Setup Guide' zero state)*.
3.  Hover over the empty "Recent Activity" or zero "Fleet Status".

**Script:**
"Notice the dashboard. It's clean. It might even look 'empty' to you. That is intentional."
"In a simulation, this screen would be flashing with fake alerts and random graphs. But this is a real tool. It is empty because **we haven't done any work yet**."
"We believe in Data Integrity. If the engineer hasn't measured it, we don't show it."

---

## **Scene 2: Real Physics (The HPP Design Studio)**
**Action:**
1.  Click on **"HPP Design Studio"** (or *HPP Builder*) from the Dashboard tools.
2.  Scroll to the Input Parameters.
3.  **Input:**
    - Gross Head: `150` m
    - Design Flow: `40` m³/s
4.  Hit **"Calculate"**.
5.  Show the results (Power Output, Turbine Type selection).

**Script:**
"Let's do some real engineering. This is the Design Studio."
"I'm inputting a Head of 150 meters and a Flow of 40 cubic meters per second."
"Available Power: ~52 Megawatts. Recommended Turbine: Francis."
"This isn't an animation. This is the **Physics Engine** running defined math in real-time. A hydro engineer can use this right now to size a prospective plant."

---

## **Scene 3: The Manual Logbook**
**Action:**
1.  Navigate back to **Dashboard**, then to **Maintenance Logbook**.
2.  Click **"New Entry"** (or similar).
3.  **Type:**
    - Title: "Morning Shift Inspection"
    - Description: "Checked turbine housing. Vibration levels normal. No leaks observed."
4.  **Save** the entry.

**Script:**
"Now, let's look at Operations. The industry doesn't need more 'AI chatbots'. It needs a reliable, digital ledger."
"I am creating a manual log entry. 'Morning Inspection - All clear'."
"It is simple. It is fast. And most importantly, it lives locally on the device. No cloud latency. No server outages. This is a field companion."

---

## **Scene 4: The Asset & Persistence**
**Action:**
1.  Click the **"Register New Plant"** button (or "+" in Sidebar).
2.  **Asset Wizard:**
    - Name: "Cetina River Unit 1"
    - Type: Francis
    - Capacity: 50 MW
3.  Complete the wizard.
4.  **Action:** Refresh the page (F5 or Reload).
5.  Show that the Asset remains in the Sidebar/Header.

**Script:**
"Let's formalize this. I'm registering a new asset: 'Cetina River Unit 1'."
"Once I register this... watch what happens when I refresh the app."
*(Refresh)*
"It's still there. We are using **Local Persistence**. The data belongs to the engineer's machine. We have built a system that respects data sovereignty."

---

## **Scene 5: The "Toolbox" Connected**
**Action:**
1.  Return to the **Dashboard** (`/`).
2.  Point to the Header: "Fleet Status: 1 Asset Active".
3.  Point to the "Recent Activity" stream: Show the "Morning Shift Inspection" log we just created.

**Script:**
"And now, we return home. Look at the Dashboard now."
"It's no longer empty. It shows '1 Asset Active'. It shows my 'Morning Shift Inspection' in the feed."
"The system is alive. Not because of a script, but because of **our actions**."
"This is the new AnoHUB. A tool for those who build. Thank you."
